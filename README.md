----------------------------------------------------------------

This is an alternative for Dropbox datastore, which has been deprecated from  April 29th, 2016. 

With Datastore; structured data (e.g. contacts, to-do items, etc.) can be stored and synced effortlessly across multiple devices. 

Files are used as database to store data.

NOTE: 
Current implementation supports Dropbox, this can be extendable for other storage providers (e.g. Box, Google Drive etc.) as well.
